} else {
  recordingTime.value = '${minutes.toString().padLeft(2, '0')}:${seconds.toString().padLeft(2, '0')}';
}

// Elapsed time calculation
void _updateElapsedTime() {
  if (recordingStartTime.value != null) {
    final now = DateTime.now();
    final difference = now.difference(recordingStartTime.value!);
    
    if (difference.inMinutes < 1) {
      elapsedTime.value = 'Just started';
    } else if (difference.inHours < 1) {
      final mins = difference.inMinutes;
      elapsedTime.value = '$mins minute${mins > 1 ? 's' : ''} ago';
    } else {
      final hours = difference.inHours;
      elapsedTime.value = '$hours hour${hours > 1 ? 's' : ''} ago';
